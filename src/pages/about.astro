      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      <p>
        Detailed route guides for remote highways and overlanding destinations, honest stories
        from the road, practical resources for trip planning, and real experiences (both good
        and challenging) from backcountry travel.
      </p>

      <h2>The Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Every guide is based on firsthand experience. Routes are driven, campsites are tested,
        and challenges are documented honestly. The goal is to provide the information you need
        to plan your own adventures with confidence.
