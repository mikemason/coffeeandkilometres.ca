## Road Conditions

The Dempster is a well-maintained gravel road, but conditions vary:

- **Dry weather**: Fast, washboarded surface
- **Wet weather**: Slippery, muddy, potential for getting stuck
- **Calcium chloride**: Used for dust control, corrosive to vehicles

**Speed**: Keep it to 50-70 km/h. Slow down for oncoming vehicles to avoid windshield damage.

## Wildlife

Expect to see:
- Grizzly bears
- Caribou (especially near Tombstone)
- Moose
- Dall sheep
- Arctic foxes
- Golden eagles

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Bear Safety">
This is serious bear country. Carry bear spray and know how to use it. Make noise when hiking.
</InfoBox>

## Camping

### Territorial Campgrounds

## Tips from the Road

1. **Start early**: Give yourself plenty of daylight
2. **Check road reports**: [DriveBC](https://drivebc.ca) and [511 Yukon](https://511yukon.ca)
3. **Wash your vehicle**: The calcium chloride is corrosive
4. **Take your time**: This isn't a race, it's an experience
5. **Respect the ferries**: Peel and Mackenzie river crossings operate on schedules

## Beyond Inuvik

Consider extending to **Tuktoyaktuk** on the Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway - an additional 140 km to reach the Arctic Ocean.

## Final Thoughts

The Dempster Highway is bucket-list worthy. With proper preparation and respect for the environment, it's an unforgettable journey through one of North America's last great wilderness areas.

Safe travels!
